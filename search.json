It only register spatial GIS data, mostly as polygons (vector) or grid (raster).\nFor each dataset, we register information on 13 fields (optional fields are indicated with *) for each dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField\nDefinition\n\n\n\n\nName\nName of the database (+ abbreviation in brackets if any)\n\n\nVariable\nVariable represented.
