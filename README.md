## Content

This folder contains a list of metadata of GIS data that are relevant for ecologists. It can be accessed online at: <https://frbcesab.github.io/terrameta/>  

This list does NOT aim to be complete with all existing GIS data but it is a collection of what have been used recently by some groups in [FRB-CESAB](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/about-the-foundation/le-cesab/).  

This list does NOT contain biodiversity field observations or traits data. It only register spatial GIS data, mostly as polygons (vector) or grid (raster).  

For each dataset, we register information on 13 fields (optional fields are indicated with *) for each dataset.   


| Field              | Definition                                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Name               | Name of the database (+ abbreviation in brackets if any)                                                     |
| Variable           | Variable represented. If many, provide a summary                                                             |
| Topic              | Among available topics (defined in Topics sheet), find the most appropriate one                              |
| Spatial extent     | Spatial extent of the dataset. So far three classes (with our FRB-CESAB focus): World, Europe and France     |
| Spatial resolution | Best available resolution. For vector, when available fill in the precision of coordinates                   |
| Time               | For time series, provide the extent and the frequency. <br> When averaging value over a time period, indicate only the middle of the time period. |
| Provider *         | Organization responsible for the data storage or author names of the publication                             |
| Status             | Information related to the license of the dataset. <br> In 5 categories: Open to all / Open to academics / Open to registered users / Restricted / Private |
| url                | main url where the data can be downloaded                                                                    |
| url_2 *            | alternative url where the data can be found (e.g. zenodo repository, r package, ...)                          |
| Citations *        | How to cite the dataset                                                                                      |
| DOI *              | doi of the scientific publication (when available).                                                          |
| View_url *         | url to the online viewer of the data (when available)                                                        |
